Hi Devin,

This company was brought to our attention early November, and we have handled our legal process with them. They are no longer an active customer for Employ/Lever. If they had postings with Job Boards, the Job Boards are responsible for the removal of those. We will review how we can try to assist in this.

I will ensure this does make it over to our security and legal team for further review, but as of now, all action has been taken from our side. We appreciate you bringing this to our attention!

Regards,
Lever Support
